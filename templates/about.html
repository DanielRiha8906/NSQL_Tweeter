    <h1>About Quacker</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Quacker, where ducks tweet better than humans, and hashtags have feathers! ðŸ¦†ðŸ“±</p>
  
    <h2>Our Quacking Mission</h2>
  
    <p>At Quacker, we believe in giving ducks a voice in the digital pond. Our mission is to create a quacking good time for everyone, whether you're a webbed expert or a tweeting novice.</p>
  
    <h2>Why Ducks?</h2>
  
    <p>Why not ducks? Ducks are nature's original social media influencers. They quack, they waddle, and they know how to make a splash. Plus, have you ever seen a duck type with its beak? It's impressive.</p>
